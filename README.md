# Sample Hardhat Project

> [!TIP]
> You should not use hardhat-viem yet. It is highly unstable and not really usable yet.

This project demonstrates a basic breaking case where one cannot even run the starter commands.

Can reproduce the issue by opening your terminal and running:

```bash
pnpm i
npx hardhat coverage
```

Tada! Hardhat broken :)
